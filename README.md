# Solar Energy Production Forecaster

**Overview:** This Python program uses a linear regression model to produce a short-term energy production forecast for a residential rooftop PV installation. The model uses historical solar energy output information and weather data to produce an estimate for future production values.

**Weather data:** I acquired solar irradiance data at 15-min intervals from [The Weather Scraper](https://github.com/Karlheinzniebuhr/the-weather-scraper) (created by [Karlheinzniebuhr](https://github.com/Karlheinzniebuhr)).

This was a personal project for an engineering workshop at Boston University, January 2025.
