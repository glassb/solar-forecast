# Solar Energy Production Forecaster

**Overview:** This program uses historical solar enery output information and weather data to produce a short-term forecast for solar energy output. 

**Weather data:** I acquired solar irradiance data at 15-min intervals from [The Weather Scraper] (https://github.com/Karlheinzniebuhr/the-weather-scraper)

This was a personal project for an engineering workshop at Boston University, January 2025.
